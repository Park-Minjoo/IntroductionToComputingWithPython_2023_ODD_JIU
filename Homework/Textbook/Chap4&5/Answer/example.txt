As I mention in Chapter 2, everything in Python, from numbers to modules, is an object.
However, Python hides most of the object machinery by means of special syntax.
You can type num = 7 to create a object of type integer with the value 7, and assign an object reference to the name num.
The only time you need to look inside objects is when you want to make your own or modify the behavior of existing objects.
Youâ€™ll see how to do both in this chapter.
